As per the brief, VirusTotal produces reports on samples of malware that was uploaded to the site.

This tool is designed to do five thing:
  -> Read in a file and scan it (Upload File)
  -> Get file report
  -> Upload URL
  -> Get URL Report
  -> Report Stats

There is a separate function for each choice, although the report stats function does not work.

Be sure to install requests using pip, otherwise, this program will not work!

You will also need a VirusTotal API key to use this tool, which you can get by making an account on the site. 
Also be aware that you are limited to four requests a minute.
